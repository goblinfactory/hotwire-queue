### Hotwire is a generalised download and queue workflow for large files:

#### Hotwire project objectives
Hotwire was primarily built to avoid a restful service provider having to invent solutions to deal with the challenge of what to do when an API requires a "file" or "document" as a parameter. Typical solutions include accepting a stream, or byte array, or by using an out of band mechanism, e.g. FTP, and simply including the filename as the parameter.

Another problem that large files present, is that accepting uploads of very large files can use up valuable bandwidth, and an overlap of even a few overlapping (long running) requests could result in a very brittle API, problems with timeouts, as well as difficulty with testing.

Hotwire attempts to address some of these problems by providing a framework that allows document publishers to "enqueue a request to download a file that's ready for processing" at a public or private uri. Hotwire provides the tools to manage a simple file based queue, and to download all the files queued for downloading, and optionally (if configured) to invoke a consumer's implementation of IProcessFile.

The core Hotwire enqueue service runs as a HttpModule? under IIS and requires only a small amount of web.config configuration, specifying such items as the folders to use for processing, downloading, queue etc, and which assembly and class implements IFileProcess.

The Uri's that the HttpModule? responds to are configurable in order that Hotwire can be configured to run as part of your existing restful API without requiring that the consumer of your API need know anything about hotwire other than the parameters required for enqueue'ing a request to download and process a document.

**Below is a sample service configuration: (not the whole configuration)**
```xml
  <hotwire>
    <queues active="true" rootServiceName="demoService" methodValidation="afterUriValidation"> 
      <endpoints>
        <add name="q1" active="true" uriTemplate="queues" action="ENQUEUE-REQUEST" httpMethods="POST" mediaType="json" security="oauth" />
        <add name="q2" active="true" uriTemplate="queues.xml" action="ENQUEUE-REQUEST" httpMethods="POST" mediaType="xml" security="oauth" />
        <add name="q3" active="true" uriTemplate="queues.json" action="ENQUEUE-REQUEST" httpMethods="POST" mediaType="json" security="oauth" />
      </endpoints>
    </queues>
    <!--  
```

**Sample folder configuration showing the filesystem based Queue repository:**

```xml
    <folders
        solutionFolderMarkerFile="HotwireSolutionFolderMarkerFile.txt"
        downloadErrorFolder =   "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\DownloadError"
        testDataFolder =        "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\TestFiles"
        downloadQueueFolder =   "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\DownloadQueue"
        processQueueFolder =    "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\ProcessQueue"
        processingFolder =      "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\Processing"
        processedFolder =       "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\Processed"
        processErrorFolder =    "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\ProcessError"
        downloadingFolder =     "Icodeon.Hotwire.TestAspNet\App_Data\HotwireFolders\Downloading"
      />
```

Note: This codebase does not include any oAuth implementations. In a later update which I will be providing shortly, if you wish to use OAuth authentication then you will need to provide a wrapper for an Oauth provider. Your wrapper must be around whichever OAuth codebase you want to use, and implement IOAuthProvider. As a result building this project using "acceptance test driven development" and of not being able to distribute certain code that are part of the acceptance tests, (but not part of the open source project) I am currently unable to provide any unit tests for this project as well as Oauth authentication. Unit tests are coming soon as a high priority, and if I can get permission from the authors of a certain Oauth provider then I'll be very pleased to include some oauth authenticated tests.

new : QuickAssert is a test class used to help produce more readable unit tests.

#### Roadmap - Product Backlog

* (done 21.05.2011) replace NLog.Logger with LoggerBase? + NullableLogger? implementation. (This will simplify tests as so many classes require Logger. I want to be able to pass in null for the logger during unit tests)
* (done 23.05.2011) Refactor ModuleBase? (http module base class) so that custom httpModules can be unit testable. Includes wrappers for httpContext, ApplicationState?, and Response)
* Acceptance tests to serve as project documentation ( I have acceptance tests, but need to sanitise them and bring them into the project)
* Move roadmap (Product backlog) to Agilezen. (apply for free o/s account).
* (done, own private CI server) CI Server? Not sure how this will work with an OS project on google code. (make a plan)
* Unit test for code coverage (same as the acceptance tests.)
* Folder watcher utility : Monitors folders and processes all enqueued items.
* Install hotwire via nuget (prerequisite better website, samples and "why use/what problem solve?")
* Fluent (code) configuration. (Currently hotwire is configured with xml in web.config.) DONE
* HTML5 front end for monitoring the queue
* Zero configuration option (Instead of explicitly telling Hotwire that class X in assembly Y implements FileProcess?, I want to use StructureMap? or similar to automatically detect it.) DONE, SUPPORTS MIX, DEFAULTS WITH FLUENT OVERRIDES
* Support for running hotwire services as a WCF service and/or under MVC. (depending on complexity. Will spike this first and implement whichever is least complex.) INVESTIGATING
* Implement Queue priority, will include HTML 5 admin tool to pause, requeue and edit queued item priorities.
* Email notification of fileProcess errors. DONE
* Use a configurable "pipeline" of process steps instead of a set of the existing hard coded folders. (this will remove a lot of code duplication in the filesProvider).
* Support multiple fileprocessors, and be able to specify which file processor processes which configured "endpoint".
* Endpoint to be mapped to a named, configured pipeline (or "named" set of directories).
* Use Structuremap or other dependancy injection framework. (was originally excluded from this project due to possible Open source licence challenges. need to review and if OK will use).
* Integration with Elmah or similar for unhandled error notification. Check licence compatibility, requirements etc. DONE
* replace filesProvider with pluggable provider and use database instead of file system.

#### Wishlist
* Contact Oauth authors and see if I can get permission to include assembly in a ready-to-use built download.
* Contact GB and see if Microsoft will allow us to include Microsoft.Http in a download as this will make testing so much neater and simpler.

#### requirements
* Visual studio 2010 sp1 (Nuget package manager, which comes with sp1 is required in order to use the included packages file. ) If you don't have Nuget, you can still download the assemblies manually.
The following packages are required in order to build the solution and are included.

```xml
<packages>
  <package id="NLog" version="2.0.0.0" />
</packages>
NLog licence is in "/Icodeon.Hotwire.Solution/packages/NLog.2.0.0.0/LICENCE.txt"
```
